# PayasoLander

This is a Game Maker Studio project, made by Omwekiatl, is a videogame for research, about the classical videogame Space Lander.

Here is a Clown Lander, that need find the correct angle and velocity to arrive good, wind can be in oposition.

This game can be handle by human commands (keyboard), or automaticly driven by neural networks.

there are two types of ANN, the MLP and DMNN, for more information about DMNN see my repository about it (is my tesis).

This software can execute the two networks, obtain behaviour patterns to train, and train with basic algorithsm.

But the train is so slow and not very good, is best export the patterns, train in other software (like my tesis software), and import the network to test.

Some functions was added at end, so GUI dont is very intuitive for that new functions, so read the text to fin what keys push.

Be free of clone, use and modify all this, but dont forget give credits to me.
